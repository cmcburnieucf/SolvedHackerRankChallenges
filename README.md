As said in the description, this repository is for storing the code I develop.
However, I only store those of challenges I found significant, in either difficulty
or new techniques/programming styles/library functions.
I am currently working on solving challenges in Python, C++, Java, MySQL, and HTML/JS/CSS.
Links will provided at the top of every program so the reader can obtain more context.
